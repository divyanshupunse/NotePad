# NotePad
Developed a Notepad application in Java! This project allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes. It uses Java 8, Collections , File I/O for storing notes, and exception handling for smooth execution. A great way to practice core Java concepts and file management while building a practical app! #Java8 #CoreJava #FileIO #Collections
